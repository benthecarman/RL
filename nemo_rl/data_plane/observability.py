"""Lean per-op metrics decorator for ``DataPlaneClient``.

Wraps any ``DataPlaneClient`` and invokes a single user-provided
callback on each operation. Each event is a flat dict::

    {"op", "partition_id", "n_keys", "n_bytes", "wall_ms", "status"}

Plug wandb / file logging / debug print at the call site by passing
``on_event=<your function>``. ``snapshot()`` returns cumulative
totals **plus** live memory consumption: ``bytes_outstanding`` (sum of
bytes currently held in TQ, i.e. put minus cleared) and
``peak_bytes_outstanding`` (high-water mark over the run lifetime).

Every method here runs on the hot path of a transfer, so nothing traverses
a structure twice and nothing is allocated for a payload no callback reads.

``verify_tensor_hash=True`` adds an opt-in correctness check:
``torch.hash_tensor`` fingerprints recorded at put and re-checked at get,
so a tensor that changes between wire-in and wire-out is reported rather
than trained on. It reads every tensor byte again on both sides, so it is a
debugging tool, not a metric. See ``README.md`` for what it does and does
not catch.

    The name carries the denominator because that is the one thing a reader
    has to know before acting on the number: it is a percentage of *the
    data plane*, not of the step. ``by_op/put = 43`` reads "43% of the time
    spent inside the data plane went to put". Whether that time mattered at all against compute is a
    different question, answered by ``step/frac_of_step``, which divides by
    the step's own wall clock. A workload can be 43% put and still not be
    worth touching.

    Two decompositions of that one total, because either alone leaves the
    next question unanswered:

    - ``by_op`` -- which call is expensive. Sums to 100 by construction.
    - ``by_cause`` -- whether that time is fixed per-request cost or moving
      bytes. ``overhead_ms``/``transfer_ms`` are per call, so they are
      multiplied back by the call count to compare against the same total.
      Only ops with an identifiable affine fit can be split (an op whose
      requests were all one size cannot be), so this sums to *at most* 100
      and the remainder is time that could not be attributed -- not time
      that did not happen.

    On the cluster path ``wall_ms`` is summed over processes that ran
    concurrently, so these are percentages of aggregate process-time rather
    than of elapsed time. That is the right denominator for "what should I
    optimise" and the wrong one for "what blocked the step".

        padding it out to a rectangle costs far more than the answer is

                uniform (``_from_wire`` densifies those), and choosing per
                layout makes the two sides compute different things. The
